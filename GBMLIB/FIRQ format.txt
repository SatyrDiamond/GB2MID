Song table
=======================================
The song table is a series of 4 16-bit (2-byte pointers). The first pointer in the table's value is the number of actual songs. The rest of the pointers are stored as follows for each song in the table:

1-2. Channel 1 pointer
3-4. Channel 2 pointer
5-6. Channel 3 pointer
7-8. Channel 4 pointer

These addresses are stored as RELATIVE values to the start of each pointer. For example, for one song, the pointers are as follows:

1. $0094
2. $037E
3. $05B8
4. $0A21

These are the addresses in the bank for each of these pointers:
1. $4662
2. $4664
3. $4666
4. $4568

When added together, the pointers in absolute values are as follows:

1. $44F6
2. $47E2
3. $4A1E
4. $4E89

Following these song pointers are the sound effects, which are each 1 channel and are also relative to the start of each pointer.

Sequence pointers
=======================================
Each channel's sequence consists of the following commands:
xx yy (X = 00-9F) = Play note, length (0 = Rest)
49 xx = Hold note
C0-DF xx = ?
E0-FC xx = Set direct channel register values
FD xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx = Set waveform
FE xx yy = Go to song loop
FF = End of song (no loop)?
