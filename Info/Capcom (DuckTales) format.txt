Song Table
=======================================
This pointer table can be found with the following instructions:
ld a, c
dec a
ld hl, SongTable
rst 28
ld h, d
ld l, e

Which equals the following in hex:
79 3D 21 ?? ?? EF 62 6B

Song header
=======================================
A header for a song is stored as follows:
1-2. Tempo
3-4. Channel 1 pointer
5-6. Channel 2 pointer
7-8. Channel 3 pointer
9-10. Channel 4 pointer

Commands
=======================================
The sequence format is very close to the company's second NES format (used from around 1987-1989), which is used in the original NES version of the game. Like its NES counterpart, the driver was either heavily modified or replaced with another driver for some of Capcom's other games, including Gargoyle's Quest and Mega Man Xtreme 1/2. Each channel's sequence is comprised of the following commands:
00 xx = Set pitch envelope (Duplicate of 01; is used to set tempo in NES version)
01 xx = Set pitch envelope
02 xx = Set duty
03 xx = Set volume
04 xx yy yy = Repeat section Y, X times
05 xx = Set base note
06 = Dotted note
07 xy = Set volume envelope
08 xx = Set modulation
09 = End of channel
21 = ?
30 = Set the following note to value from "alternate" length table
xx (40-FF) = Play note
