Song table
=======================================
The song table contains pointers to all four channels of each song or sound effect. It can be found using the following code:

add hl, hl
add hl, hl
add hl, hl
add hl, bc
ld bc, SongTable
add hl, bc

Which equals the following in hex:
29 29 29 09 01 ?? ?? 09

Pointers are stored as follows:

1-2. Channel 1 pointer
3-4. Channel 2 pointer
5-6. Channel 3 pointer
7-8. Channel 4 pointer
9. Unknown (priority?)

A pointer value of 0xFFFF means that the channel is not used.

Channel header
=======================================
Pointers for each channel lead to a "header" which is stored as follows:
1-2. Channel pointer
3. Unknown, always 81?
4. FF = End of header?

Sequence commands
=======================================
Sequences for each channel are comprised of the following commands:
xx yy (X = 00-7F) = Play note, length (X = Note, Y = Length)
80 (yy) = Rest
81 = ?
9x = Set channel/noise type
Ax yy zz aa bb cc dd ee ff gg hh ii = Set channel/instrument parameters
Bx yy = Set frequency?
C0 xx = Set channel volumes (NR50)
C1 xx = Set panning?
C2 xx = Repeat the following section X times
C3 = Song loop point
C4 = Go to repeat point/song loop point
C5 xx xx = Go to macro
C6 = ?
C7 = ?
Dx yy = Portamento?
Ex yy = Set tuning
FF = End of channel or return from macro

Ultima: Runes of Virtue
=======================================
Ultima: Runes of Virtue uses a variant of the driver with several differences:
 - Ax command only uses 11 bytes.
 - 82 will enable "note mode", where each of the following notes are selected from a table of pre-defined note values, based on division by 8 which is 28 bytes long. The remainder will be used to determine the length of the note, based on the speed value controlled by command 83:
0 = x
1 = x / 2
2 = x / 4
3 = x / 8
4 = x / 16
5 = x * 0.75
6 = x * 0.75 / 2
7 = x * 0.75 / 4
If the division equals 1C, then the following byte will be used to play a manually defined note. (use 1 more byte)
If the division equals 1D, then it is a rest.
If the division equals 1E, then exit "note mode".
 - 83 xx will control the speed for the "note mode".
