Song Table
=======================================
The song table is comprised of 16-bit pointers to each song. It can be found using the following code:

ld hl, SongTable
rst 20
ld hl, ????
ld [hl], e
inc hl
ld [hl], d
ld a, [de]

Which equals the following in hex:
21 ?? ?? E7 21 8D XX XX 73 23 72 1A

Song headers
=======================================
A header for a song is stored as follows:
1. Channel mask
(Format: 1234 5678 - 1-4 = SFX, 5-8 = Music)
(Note that the following apply only if the channel mask includes the following channels:)
2-3. Channel 1 pointer
4-5. Channel 2 pointer
6-7. Channel 3 pointer
8-9. Channel 4 pointer
