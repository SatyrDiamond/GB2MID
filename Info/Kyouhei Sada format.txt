Song pointer list
=======================================
Music and sound effects are stored the same way, and are accessed via the same pointer table. The pointer table can be found with the following instructions:

	ld d,$00
	ld e,a
	ld h,$00
	ld l,a
	sla l
	rl h
	add hl,de
	ld d,h
	ld e,l

	ld hl,soundPointers
	add hl,de

Which equals the following in hex:
16 00 5F 26 00 6F CB 25 CB 14 19 54 5D 21 ?? ?? 19

Song pointers
=======================================
Song pointers are structured as follows:
1. Bank number (relative from sound engine bank, starting with 00)
2-3. Pointer to song

Song headers
=======================================
Each song has a "header" specifying a pointer to each channel in a song. It is structured as follows:
1. XY = Channel mask (X = ?, Y = channel number):
	0 = Channel 1 music
	1 = Channel 2 music
	2 = Channel 1 SFX
	3 = Channel 2 SFX
	4 = Channel 3 music
	5 = Channel 3 SFX
	6 = Channel 4 music
	7 = Channel 4 SFX
2-3. Pointer to song channel
(Repeat until FF value below)
FF = End of header

(NOTE: For most games, the header is stored in the song's bank. For Zelda games, it is always stored in the first bank.)

Sequence commands
=======================================
Commands in a sequence of a song or sound effect are comprised of the following:
xx yy (x = 00-5F) = Play note
60 xx = Rest (v1)
61 xx = Rest (v2)
xx yy (xx = 62-7F?) = Play additional notes (channel 4)?
Dx = Set volume
Ex xx = Set envelope
F0 xx = Turn on sweep/modulation mode (notes on channels 1 and 2 take up three bytes)
F1-F3 = ?
F4-F5 = ? (duplicates of FF?)
F6 xx = Set duty
F7 = ? (duplicate of FF?)
F8 xx = Set wave counter 1
F9 xx = Set vibrato
FA-FC = ? (duplicate of FF?)
FD xx = Set wave counter 2
FE xxxx = Jump to position
FF = Stop channel
