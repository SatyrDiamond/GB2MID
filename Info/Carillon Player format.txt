Block order list
=======================================
Each song is comprised of blocks, or patterns. The block order list is always located at address $4F00, and is $100 (128) bytes long.
The block order list consists of single bytes which are each the low byte of a pointer to the address of the pattern (the high byte is always $00).

Song patterns end with any of the following methods:
 - $00 (default) = Loop from beginning
 - $xx (block number) = Loop from block number
 - $FF = End song without loop

It is possible to store up to 8 distinct songs in one bank. These are always stored at the following list positions:
Song 0 - Starting at $00
Song 1 - Starting at $80
Song 2 - Starting at $40
Song 3 - Starting at $c0
Song 4 - Starting at $20
Song 5 - Starting at $60
Song 6 - Starting at $a0
Song 7 - Starting at $e0

Block data
=======================================
Each block of a song is always 256 bytes, consisting of 32 8-byte rows. A maximum of 32 blocks can be stored.
Each row of a block is 8 bytes, which are comprised of the following values:
1. Channel 1 note
2. Channel 1 instrument
3. Channel 2 note
4. Channel 2 instrument
5. Channel 3 note
6. Channel 3 instrument
7. Channel 4 instrument
8. Command (xy - X = effect, Y = parameter)

Note that for some reason, notes increase every 2 values instead of 1.

Effects are as follows:
0 = No effect
1 = Modulate channel (vibrato)
2 = Slide channel
3 = Set vibrato width
4 = Set vibrato rate
5 = Init slide up
6 = Init slide down
7 = Set tempo
8 = Pattern break (parameter has no effect)
