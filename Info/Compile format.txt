Song table
=======================================
The song table is comprised of pointers for both songs and sound effects.
In Godzilla, the song table can be found with the following instructions:

ld c, a
add a
ld e, a
ld d, $00
ld hl, SongTable
add hl, de

Which equals the following in hex:
4F 87 5F 16 00 21 ?? ?? 19

All song pointers are 16-bit (2 byte values) which are all located in a single bank.
In all other games, which support multiple banks (although all songs in Pocket Puyo 2 are contained in a single bank), the song table's pointer can be found at the start of a bank (address $4000). Each pointer is followed by a single byte which specifies the number of the bank the current song data is located in, as follows:
1. Song bank
2-3. Song pointer

Song header
=======================================
Each song or sound effect is comprised of a "header" which is described as a single byte specifying the number of channels present in the song followed by the following data for each channel:

1. Channel number (of song)
2. Channel ID (1 = melodic, 2 = noise?)
3. Envelope speed
4. Envelope amount
5. Vibrato
6. Transpose
7. Tempo
8. Channel number (of hardware)
9-10. Pointer
11. Duty (CH1-2)/waveform (CH3)/unused? (CH4)
12. End of header/flag

Commands
=======================================
Data for each channel's track is comprised of the following commands:

00-7F = Set note (00 = Rest)
80 xx xx = Go to song loop
81 xx yy yy = End of repeat - go to position (X = Control level/RAM address, Y = Position)
82 = End of channel (no loop)
83 xx = Vibrato
84 xx = Portamento time
85 xx = Play song ID
86 = ?
87 xx = Set volume/envelope (v1)
