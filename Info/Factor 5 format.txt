Song table
=======================================
The song table is comprised of 16-bit (2-byte) pointers to each song.

Song patterns
=======================================
These are a series of 16-bit pointers to each pattern of a song. These end with two possible terminator strings: 0000 = Song ends with no loop, and xxFF = Loop back to position -X.

Sequences
=======================================
Each pointer leads to the sequence header, which consists of 4 16-bit pointers, one for each channel. A value of 0000 of any pointer means that the channel is not used during the sequence.
1-2. Channel 1 pointer
3-4. Channel 2 pointer
5-6. Channel 3 pointer
7-8. Channel 4 pointer

The sequence data for each channel is comprised of a series of 3 bytes for each row of a pattern:

1. Row length/flags - other values are different if flag
2. Note
3. Instrument

Flags are as follows:
FD xx 00 = Rest
FE xx yy = Repeat: go back to position -Y, X times
FF xx = End of sequence (X = ?)
