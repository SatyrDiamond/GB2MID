Song table
=======================================
There are two main variants of this driver: a single-banked version and a multi-banked version.

The single-banked version is found using the following code:
ld c, a
ld b, 00
ld hl, SongTable
add hl, bc
add hl, bc

Which equals the following in hex:
4F 06 00 21 ?? ?? 09 09

For the multi-banked version, the following code is used:
xor a
ld d, a
ld hl, BankMapping
add hl, de
ld a, [hl]
call ????
ld hl, SongTable
add hl, de
add hl, de
ldi a, [hl]
ld b, [hl]
ld c, a

Which equals the following in hex:
AF 57 21 ?? ?? 19 7E CD xx xx 21 ?? ?? 19 19 2A 46 4F

The bank-mapping is a series of single bytes that specifies the bank number.

Song header
=======================================
Song headers are structured as follows:
1. Number of channels
2. Music/SFX identifier (if lower 4 bits are 0, than music, if lower 4 bits are 8, then SFX)
3. Channel identifier (13 = 1, 18 = 2, 1D = 3, 22 = 4)
4-5. Channel pointer
6. Channel transpose
7. End of channel flag?
(Repeat 2-7 for number of channels)

(NOTE: some games have 2 bytes between the number of channels and the music/SFX identifier.)

Song commands
=======================================
Songs are comprised of the following commands:
xx (00-7F) = Set note length (and play note)
(For most variants on channel 4, it is xx yy (X = Drum note, Y = Length, if Y is less than 80.)
80-DF (xx) = Play note (80 = rest) (If X is less than 80, then X = length.)
E0-E2 = (Invalid)
E3 xx = End of channel (no loop)
E4 xy = Set envelope
E5 xx xx = Jump to position (usually used for loop)
E6 xx = Set transpose (in addition to specified in header)
E7 xx yy zz zz  = Repeat (instance X) section Z for Y times 
E8 xx = Set distortion effect?
E9 xx = Set pan?
EA xx xx = Set tempo (Another Bible only)
EC xx xx = Go to macro
ED = Exit macro
EE xx = Set duty
EF xx = Set sweep
F0 = Turn off vibrato?
F1 xx = Set vibrato?
F2 = Turn on vibrato?
F3 xx = Set waveform
F4 xx = End of channel (no loop) (v2)?
F5 xx = Set note size
F6 xx = Set tempo
F7-F9 = (Invalid)
FA xx = Hold note?
FB-FF = (Invalid)

Sanrio Carnival variant
=======================================
The game Sanrio Carnival uses a non-standard variation of the driver with the following differences:
 - There are two bytes following the number of channels in the header representing the current tempo.
 - The "set note length" command does not additionally play a note of that length.
 - The "play note" command does not ever use an additional byte for the length.
 - The commands F5 and F6 are used for conditional jumps, as follows:
F5 = Conditional jump 1 to position Y on time X (F5 xx yy yy)
F6 = Conditional jump 2 to position Y on time X (F6 xx yy yy)
