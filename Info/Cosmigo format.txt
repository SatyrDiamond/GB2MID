Pointers
=======================================
The essential pointers are found at the beginning of the sound bank as follows:
0x400C = Song list
0x400E = Sequence pointer list
0x4010 = Instrument list?
0x4012 = Instrument data
0x4014 = Waveform list

Alternatively, in the homebrew game "Margo", pointers are instead referred to in the following locations:
0x4021 = Song list
0x40DA = Sequence pointer list
0x4324 = Instrument list?
0x432F = Instrument data
0x45E1 = Waveform list

Song list
=======================================
The song list (for both music and sound effects) is structured as follows:
1-2 = Pointer
3 = Length of each song pattern
4 = Tempo/number of ticks
5 = Volume (Max: 7)

Song patterns
=======================================
This is a tracker-based engine which uses patterns. The structure is as follows:
1. Channel 1 sequence
2. Channel 1 transpose
3. Channel 2 sequence
4. Channel 2 transpose
5. Channel 3 sequence
6. Channel 3 transpose
7. Channel 4 sequence

Any of the channel sequence numbers can be substituted with one of the following commands:
FD = Empty pattern
FE = End of song (no loop)
FF xx yy = End of song (loop, XX = restart position, y = ?)

Sequence data
=======================================
Sequences of note data are structured as follows for each row:
1. Instrument (if 0, then no change)
2. Effect/parameter:
  X = Effect, Y = Parameter
  Effects:
  0 = No effect
  1 = Vibrato up
  2 = Vibrato down
  3 = Volume slide up?
  4 = Volume slide down?
3. Note (if FE, then empty, if FD, then stop note?)
