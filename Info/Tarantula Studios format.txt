Song Table
=======================================
The song table is usually found at the start of the first sound bank. It consists of pointers to individual channels of both songs and sound effects.
Reservoir Rat and Montezuma's Return!, originally released for the original Game Boy before being released again as Game Boy Color versions, store all their music/sound effects data in one bank (except for 2 songs in Montezuma's Return!), and the table is structured as follows:
1. Number of songs
(Repeat until end)
1-2. Channel 1 pointer
3-4. Channel 2 pointer
5-6. Channel 3 pointer
7-8. Channel 4 pointer

The rest of the games store their data across multiple banks, and use the following structure:
1. Number of songs
(Repeat until end)
1-2. Channel 1 pointer
3. Channel 1 bank
4-5. Channel 2 pointer
6. Channel 2 bank
7-8. Channel 3 pointer
9. Channel 3 bank
10-11. Channel 4 pointer
12. Channel 4 bank

Note that for a song or sound effect where a channel is not used, the value 0x0000 is used.

Sequence commands
=======================================
Sequence commands of a channel are as follows:

1. Time of note
2. Note/flags
 - If bit 7 is set, then event
 - Otherwise, If bit 5 is set, then retain the previous saved time (no byte 1); if neither, then new time of note value byte afterwards
 - Remaining bits (if not time or event: note)

Event values:
 - 8x = Set panning?
 - 9x/Dx = Volume (if Dx, then start skipping the time)
 - A0 xx yy zz = Pitch bend (X = parameter 1, Y = parameter 2, Z = time, triggers "skip next time")
 - A1 xx = Repeat the following section X times
 - A2 = End of repeat point
 - E0 xx yy = Pitch bend
 - FF = End of track
