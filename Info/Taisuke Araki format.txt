Song table
=======================================
The song table consists of 16-bit pointers to each song. In Donkey Kong and later games, the code is as follows:
ld hl, SongTable
sla a
ld e, a
ld d, $00
add hl, de

Which equals the following in hex:
21 ?? ?? CB 27 5F 16 00 19

Previous games (Wave Race and Top Ranking Tennis), however, use different methods. GBC games use a multi-banked system where the bank numbers used for different songs are hardcoded into the driver.

Song headers and patterns
=======================================
Headers for each song are comprised of 16-bit pointers to each channel, plus a "step pointer" which points to an array of note lengths. These are structured as follows:

1. Unknown (0 byte), only present in Wave Race and Top Ranking Tennis
2-3. Step table pointer
5. Tempo, only present in Hamtaro/Tottoko Hamutarou games
6-7. Channel 1 pointer
8-9. Channel 2 pointer
10-11. Channel 3 pointer
12-13. Channel 4 pointer

Each pointer leads to a "pattern", which is a list of pointers leading to each phrase that is played. The following commands are used:
xxxx = Pointer to phrase
0000 = End of song (no loop)
FFFF xxxx = Go to song pattern loop point

Channel phrases
=======================================
Channel phrases are used by each channel to play a section of the song as part of the pattern. In most games, the following commands are used:
00 = Exit phrase
01 = Rest
02-C9 = Play note (in Top Ranking Tennis, higher notes play sound effects)
CA = Extend note length (not present in Top Ranking Tennis)
D0-EA = Set channel speed (speed values are from speed pointer in song header)
EB xx = Repeat the following section X times
EC = End of repeat
ED (aa bb) xx yy yy = Set panning/waveform info? (A/B only used on channel 3)
EE xx yy = ?
F0 xx yy zz (aa) = Set instrument parameters (X = delay), A is only used if Y (mask) is 41; some GBC games use additional flags, including 14 (1 additional byte like 41), 54 (2 additional bytes), 55 (3 additional bytes)
F1 xx xx = Set pitch bend pointer
F2 = Disable pitch bend
F3 xx yy zz = Set vibrato effect?
F4 xx = Delay for X time
F5 xx xx = Set volume envelope pointer?
F6 = Activate "slow motion" mode? (only present in GBC games)
FF xx xx = Jump to position

However, in Wave Race, the first game to use this engine, the commands are different and instead are as follows:
00 = End of phrase
01 = Rest
02-91 = Play note
9B xx = Repeat the following section X times
9C = End of repeat
9D (aa bb) xx yy yy = Set panning/waveform info? (A/B only used on channel 3)
9E = ?
9F = ?
A0-AF = Set note size
B0 xx yy zz = Set instrument parameters
B1 xx xx =  Set pitch bend/tuning
B3 xx yy zz = Play sound effect
