Song table
=======================================
The song table consists of 16-bit (2-byte) pointers to each song or sound effect.

Song headers
=======================================
Each song or sound effect has a "header" which consists of a binary mask telling which channels are used, as well as the pointers to each channel's sequence. It is stored as follows:
1. Channel mask (format: 1234 = channels 1-4)
2-3. Channel 1 pointer (if present)
4-5. Channel 2 pointer (if present)
6-7. Channel 3 pointer (if present)
8-9. Channel 4 pointer (if present)

Channel sequences
=======================================
Sequences for each channel are comprised of the following commands:

xy (00-CF) = Play note, length (X = Note (0 = Rest), Y = Length)
D0-D5 = Set octave
D6 = Raise octave
D7 = Lower octave
D8 xx = Set decay?
D9 xx = Set duty
DA xx = Set panning
DB xx = Set channel speed
DC xx = Set channel effect?
DD xx = Set envelope (absolute)
DE xx = Set envelope (relative)
DF xx = Set tuning (absolute)
E0 xx = Set tuning (relative)
E1 xx = Repeat the following section X times
E2 = End of repeat section
E3 xx xx = Jump to position on final repeat
E4 xx xx = Go to song loop
E5 xx xx = Go to macro
E6 = Return from macro
E7 xx = ?
E8 xx = Set transpose (absolute)
E9 xx = Set transpose (relative)
EA xx = ?
EB xx = Set note size
EC xx = Set arpeggio effect
ED xx = ?
EE xx yy = Set vibrato
EF xx = Set channel unknown
F0-FD = (Invalid)
FE = Tie to next note
FF = End of channel (no loop)

Late version
=======================================
Several late games, including all the Dance Dance Revolution games, use a different version of the driver with an entirely different set of commands. The song table is also slightly different as it is multi-banked, and each pointer is preceded by a 1-byte value specifying the bank number of each track.

Sequences for each channel are comprised of the following commands:
xx yy (X = 00-7F) = Play note, length (0 = Rest)
8x = Set note size
90 xx = Set envelope decay
91-94 = Set duty
95 xx = Set waveform
96 = Set panning: left only
97 = Set panning: left and right
98 = Set panning: right
99 = Set noise type 1
9A = Set noise type 2
9B xx = Set envelope volume (absolute)
9C xx = Set envelope volume (relative)
9D xx = Set tuning (absolute)
9E xx = Set tuning (relative)
9F xx = Repeat the following section X times 
A0 = End of repeat section
A1 xx xx = Jump to position on final repeat
A2 xx xx = Go to song loop
A3 xx xx = Go to macro
A4 = Return from macro
A5 xx = ?
A6 xx = Set transpose (absolute)
A7 xx = Set transpose (relative)
A8 xx = Set pitch bend (up)
A9 xx = Set pitch bend (down)
AA xx yy = Set channel pitch effect
AB xx = ?
AC = End of channel
AD xx = ?
AE xx = Set global volume
FF = Tie to next note
