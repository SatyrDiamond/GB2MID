Song table
=======================================
The song table consists of both music and sound effects. It can be found with the following code:
ld h, $00
ld l, a
add hl, hl
add de, SongTable
add hl, de
ld e, hl
inc hl

Which equals the following in hex:
26 00 6F 29 11 ?? ?? 19 5E 23

Song headers
=======================================
Each song or sound effect has a "header" which is constructed as follows:
1. Number of channels
2. Channel mask (xy, X = Channel number - 0-3 = music, 4-7 = SFX, Y = ?)
3-4. Pointer
(Repeat 2-4 for each channel)

Sequence data
=======================================
Channel sequences are comprised of the following commands:
(NOTE: The following commands are for Bubble Bobble. VCMDs differ slightly in some later games.)

00 = End of channel
01-8B = Set note length
8C xx = Set volume
8D xx = Set sweep
8E xx = Set duty
8F xx yy = Set tuning and play note (X = Note, Y = Tuning value)
9C xx = Set noise
9D xx = Set waveform
9E xx = Set panning
9F xx = Set global volume
AC xx xx = Go to song loop
AD xx = Set length/envelope
AE = Repeat note
AF = ?
BC = ?
BD = ?
EE = Rest
Other values = Play note
