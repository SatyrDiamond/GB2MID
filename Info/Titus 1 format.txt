Song pointer table
=======================================
The song pointer table is a series of four 16-bit (2-byte) pointers to the channel of each song, not necessarily the same order as the Game Boy's channels, followed by the tempo, again as a 16-bit value. It is structured as follows:
1-2 = Channel 3 pointer
3-4 = Channel 1 pointer
5-6 = Channel 2 pointer
7-8 = Channel 4 pointer
9-10 = Tempo

It can be found at the following addresses (two of these games are right at the start of the sound data):
$4000 - The Blues Brothers
$3A99 - Nick Faldo Golf
$5040 - Titus the Fox: To Marrakech and Back

Sound effect pointer table
=======================================
The sound effect pointer table can be found shortly after the song pointer table, and is a series of 16-bit pointers. These use the same commands as songs (see below), but only use channel 3 and run at the same speed.

Song commands
=======================================
Commands for each song and sound effects are structured as follows:
xy (00-7F) = Note (0C = rest)
X = Octave, Y = Note
(Y values:
 0 = C
 1 = C#
 2 = D
 3 = D#
 4 = E
 5 = F
 6 = F#
 7 = G
 8 = G#
 9 = A
 A = A#
 B = B
 C = Rest
 D = D (octave higher)
 E = C (2 octaves higher)
 F = C# (1 octave higher)
80-AF = Change speed:
 - Discard all but the bottom 3 bits
 - If resulting value is not 7:
 - Then shift the value $60 to the left the remaining number
 - If resulting value is 7, then instead use "alternate" value (see below)
B0-BF = Set "alternate" speed value:
 - Discard all but the bottom 3 bits
 - Then shift the value $40 to the left the remaining number
C0-EF = Set instrument?
F0 xxxx = Go to macro
F1 xx = Repeat following section
F2 xxxx = Jump to position
F3 = Exit macro
F4 xxxx = Go to loop point
F5-FE = ?
FF = End of sequence

Note: Due to a bug in the sound engine, the first note on channel 3 is not heard. The wave channel RAM also tends to get corrupted at times when the music changes, making channel 3 in the music and all sound effects sound different.
