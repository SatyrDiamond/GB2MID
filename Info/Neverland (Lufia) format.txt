Song table
=======================================
The song table, as well as the main sound engine code, can be found at bank 21 (starting with 1) at offset $6500 in all three ROM versions. The song table is structured as follows:
1-2. Pointer to song
3. Bank number (starting with 0)

Song header
=======================================
Each song has a "header" which is 84 bytes:
1-4. "GB2M" in ASCII
5. Stereo flag?
6. Channel mask?
7. Number of channels
(If any of the following channels are unused, the value $FFFF is used here)
8-9. Channel 3 pointer (always $0054)
10-11. Channel 1 pointer
12-13. Channel 2 pointer
14-15. Channel 4 pointer
(If any of the following channels are unused, all length values are 0)
16-32. Channel 3 note length list
33-49. Channel 1 note length list
50-66. Channel 2 note length list
67-83. Channel 4 note length list

Each of the note length lists, if not all 0, consists of 6 bytes, a terminator value FF, and then 6 more bytes of unknown meaning.

Song commands
=======================================
Songs are comprised of the following commands:

xx (00-7F) yy (zz) (aa) (bb) = Play note
 - This is followed by a length value, see below
80-EF = Delay
F0 xx = Set volume?
F1 xx = Set envelope?
F2 xx = Set vibrato
F3 xx = Set instrument parameters?
F4 xx = Set waveform
F5 xx yy = Delay (X) and change frequency by signed amount (Y)
F6 xx = Set sweep
F7 xx = Set noise type
F8 xx = Short delay
F9 xx = Read bytes from relative position (optimized function)
FA xx yy = Read Y bytes from relative position -X
FB = Loop point
FC (xx) yy = Manual note length (X) and manual size (Y) (X only used for channel 3?)
FD xx yy = Set duty
FE xx yy = Manual note length (X) and volume/envelope(Y)?
FF = End of track (go to loop point if present in song)

Code to find the lengths of notes:
In order to determine the length, of notes, three tests are performed:

Test 1:
AND %11100000
Swap upper and lower nibbles
SRL A
CP 7

Test 2:
AND A, %00011100
SRL A
SRL A
CP 7

If test 1 passes, then the byte's resulting value is used as a reference to the note length from the table.
If test 1 fails, then it is defined manually with a 3-4 byte command.
If test 2 fails, then an additional test is performed:

Test 3:
AND A, 00000111
CP A, 3
If this test fails, then an an additional byte is also used to define the note size.

Byte B is only used if Y is equal to FF.



F9 command formula:
(To get the amount of bytes to get:)
AND A, %11100000
SWAP A
SRL A
ADD A, $02

(To get the amount of bytes back:)
AND A, %00011100
ADD A, $02
