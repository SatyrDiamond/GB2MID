Song table
=======================================
The song table is comprised of 16-bit (2-byte) pointers for songs as well as sound effects. Usually, it can be found with the following code:
push af
ld a, [????]
cp a, FF
jr z, ????
pop af
ld bc, SongTable

Which equals the following in hex:
F5 FA xx xx FE FF 28 F2 F1 01 ?? ??

For early games from 1990, it is instead with the following code:
bit 7, a
jr z, ????
cp a, 97
jr nc, ????
sub a, 80
jr z, ????
ld hl, SongTable
Which equals the following in hex:
CB 7F 28 21 FE 97 30 1E D6 80 28 19 21 ?? ??

In several late games, each of the pointers in the table is followed by 1 byte specifying the bank number the song is present inside.

Song headers
=======================================
Each song has a "header" which specifies information about each channel's track. For most games, it is structured as follows:

Song header:
1. Number of channels
2-3. Tempo

Channel header:
1-2. Pointer to sequence data
3. Transpose
4. Vibrato
5. Duty?
6. Channel number

However, for early games, the header is different:
1. Number of channels
(Repeat for all channels)
1. Panning?
2. Channel number
3. ?
4-5. Pointer to sequence data
6. Transpose
7. Vibrato
8. Envelope

Sequence commands
=======================================
Sequences for each channel are comprised of the following commands:

00-7F = Set note length
80-E0 (xx) (yy) = Play note (80 = Rest), if X is less than 80, then set length
 - If in pitch bend mode, then X = Pitch bend amount, Y = Length
E1 xx xx = Go to macro
E2 = Exit macro
E3 = End of channel (no loop)
E4 xx yy zz zz = Repeat section (X = Control number, Y = Number of times, Z = Position)
E5 xx xx = Go to song loop
E6 xx = Set envelope (v2)
E7 xx = Add to transpose
E8 xx = Set duty
E9 xx = ?
EA xx = Set waveform
EB = End of channel (v2)?
EC = Turn on pitch bend mode
ED = Turn off pitch bend mode
EE = Hold note?
EF = Turn off hold note?
F0 xx = Set vibrato
F1 xx = ?
F2 xx = ?
F3 xx = Set envelope
F4 xx = ?
