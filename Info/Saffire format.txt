Song values
=======================================
While there (at least observed) aren't any standard song tables, the code initializes pointers to each song with 3 variables. These are as follows:

1. Bank number
2. Tempo
3. Loop flag (0 = no, 1 = yes)

Song patterns
=======================================
Songs are stored in a very simple yet also very inefficient array of patterns of 6 bytes each, using time values like Ed Magnin, although only for 1 channel at a time. Patterns are structured as follows (note that 16-bit values are big-endian):

1-2. Total time
3. Channel number
4. Envelope/volume flag
5-6. Note frequency
