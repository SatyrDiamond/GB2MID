Song table
=======================================
The song table can be found with the following instructions:
ld [????], a
push af
call ????
pop af
ld hl, SongTable

Which equals the following in hex:
EA xx xx F5 CD xx xx F1 ?? ??

The song table is comprised of a series of either 3 or 4 pointers to various channels. Q Billion and Oni have only 3 channel pointers, not using channel 3, while other games have 4 pointers; however, no games appear to actually use channel 3 outside of sound effects.

Sequence data
=======================================
Commands for each channel sequence are as follows:
xx yy = Play note, length (X = Note, Y = Length)
F2 xx = Set note size
F4 xx = ?
F5 xx = Set duty
F6 xx = Set envelope
F7 xx = ?
FB xx = Song loop point
FC xx = End of repeat section - in the last 2 games, this is start of repeat point
FD xx = Repeat the following section (in earlier games, this starts from 00; in other games, this starts from 01) - in last 2 games, this means go to repeat point X times
FE xx = End of channel
