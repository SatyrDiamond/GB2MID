Song pattern table
=======================================
The song pattern table is a series of 5 pointers for patterns for each channel of a song. Interestingly, channel 4 uses 2 patterns. It can be found with the following code:
sla c
rlc b
sla c
rlc b
add hl, bc
ld bc, SongTable
add hl, bc

Which equals the following in hex:
CB 21 CB 00 CB 21 CB 00 09 01 ?? ?? 09

Song pattern tables are structured as follows:
1-2. Channel 1 pointer
3-4. Channel 2 pointer
5-6. Channel 3 pointer
7-8. Channel 4 pointer (1)
9-10. Channel 4 pointer (2)

Sequence table
=======================================
The sequence table consists of 2-byte (16-bit) pointers to each sequence. It can be found with the following code:
ld l, a
ld h, $00
add hl, hl
ld bc, SeqTable
add hl, bc
inc de
ld a, e

Which equals the following in hex:
6F 26 00 29 01 ?? ?? 09 13 7B

Song channel patterns
=======================================
Song channel patterns are structured with the following commands:
00-7F = Play pattern
80 xx = Set transpose
A0 = End of repeat section
A1 xx = Repeat the following section X times
FD xx xx = Loop back to pattern position
FE = Loop back to start of pattern
FF = End of pattern (no loop)

Sequence commands
=======================================
Sequences use the following commands:
00-7F = Play note
80 xx = Set note length (custom/manual value)
81-9F = Set note length
A0 = Initialize channel envelopes?
A1 xx (yy zz) = Set channel envelope (use Y and Z for channel 3)
A2 xx yy zz = Set pitch modulation
A3 xx yy zz = Set duty parameters
A4 xx yy zz = Set arpeggio
A5 xx yy = Set sweep
A6 xx yy zz = Set vibrato
A7 xx = Set waveform
B0 xx = Delay for length X
C0 = Enable portamento
C1 = Disable portamento
D0 xx xx = Go to macro position
D1 = Exit macro
FF = End of sequence
