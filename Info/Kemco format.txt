Song Table
=======================================
For earlier games, this pointer table can be found with the following instructions:
sub a, 01
sla a
ld hl, SongTable
call ????

Which equals the following in hex:
D6 01 CB 27 21 ?? ?? CD xx xx

For later games, the following instructions are used:
sla a
ld c, a
ld b, $00
ld hl, SongTable
add hl, bc
ldi a, [hl]

Which equals the following in hex:
CB 27 4F 06 00 21 ?? ?? 09 2A

There are three different versions of the driver. For the first version, used in most games:
1. Channel mask (if 0, then all 4 channels, if 1, all 4, but 1 and 2 are inverted, if more, than only some channels)
2-3. Channel 1 pointer
4-5. Channel 2 pointer
6-7. Channel 3 pointer
8-9. Channel 4 pointer
10. Tempo

For most games from 1999 and later:
1. Channel mask
2. Tempo
3-4. Channel 1 pointer
5-6. Channel 2 pointer
7-8. Channel 3 pointer
9-10. Channel 4 pointer

Sequence commands
=======================================
Sequences are comprised of the following commands:
00-04 = Set channel volumes?
xx (10-7D) = Play note
7E = Rest
7F = Connect - Add the current note's length to the next note's length
xx (80-BF) = Set note size
C0-C9 = Repeat point
CA = Song loop point
CF = Go to repeat point/loop point
Dx = Play the following section if on repeat number X from Cx, otherwise skip to next CF command
Ex yy yy = Set instrument (in late games, Ex yy)
FF = End of channel

Differences in version 2
=======================================
 - The following commands have been added:
05 = ?
06 xx = ?
07 = ?
08 xx = Transpose
0A xx = Portamento
7D = Rest
CE = Song loop point (same as CA?)
 - The "connect" function (7F) works differently.
 - The Dx command also looks for another Dx command as a jump position if the section is skipped.

Differences in version 3
=======================================
The final version, used only in Batman of the Future and Tweety's High-Flying Adventure, is very similar to version 2, but some commands are different or added:
07 = Repeat the following section 2 times
08 = On 2nd "07" repeat, play the following section, else skip to 09
09 = End of "07" repeat section
0B xx = ?
0C xx = ?
0D xx = ?
0E xx = ?
0F xx = ?
