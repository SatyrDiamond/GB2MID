Song table
=======================================
The song table consists of both music and sound effects. It can be found with the following code:
set 7, a
ldi [hl], a
inc hl
res 7, [hl]
ld hl, SongTable
ld de, ????

Which equals the following in hex:
CB FF 22 23 CB BE 21 ?? ?? 11 xx xx

Song headers
=======================================
Each song or sound effect has a "header" which is constructed as follows:
1. Song note pointer (add to "base address" plus value x 0x10)
2-3. Channel 1 pointer
4-5. Channel 2 pointer
6-7. Channel 3 pointer
8-9. Channel 4 pointer

If any of the following pointer values are 0000 or FFFF, then they are not used.

In later games, including some GBC games by Natsume, 1 is instead used as a tempo value (note lengths are always the same).

Sequence data
=======================================
Channel sequences are comprised of the following commands:
00-4F = Set note
5x = Set decay/release
6x = Set noise type
7x = Set duty/volume?
8x = Tie note (add length)
9x = Play note with length
Ax = Rest
Bx = Cut off note/rest?
C0 = End of channel (no repeat)
C2 xx = Repeat the following section (1)
C4 xx = Repeat the following section (2)
C6 xx xx = End of repeat section - jump to position X
C8 xx xx = End of repeat section - jump to position X (2)
CA xx xx = Go to macro
CC xx xx = Go to song loop
CE = Return from macro
D0 xx = Set pitch sweep speed
D2 xx = Set tuning
D4 = Set tuning to 0
D6 xx yy = Set vibrato
D8 = Reset tuning
DA xx xx yy = Set transpose/tuning and delay (X = Transpose, Y = Delay) 
DC xx = Set envelope
DE xx = Set global volume?
E0 xx = Set envelope (v2)
E2 = Reset envelope?
E4 xx = Set envelope (v3)
E6 xx xx = Pitch bend effect amount
E8 xx yy = Sweep effect
EA xx = Set noise frequency?
EC xx = Noise effect?
EE xx = Set pitch effect?
F0 xx = Set effect volume?
F2 xx = ?
F4 xx = ?
F6 xx = ?
